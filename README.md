## Express.js-Challenge-Note-Taker
## Description
This challenge, We were tasked with creating an application that can be used to write and save notes. The app uses an Express.js back-end and will save and retrieve user generated note data.

The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's our job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the finished application to Heroku.

## User Story
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
